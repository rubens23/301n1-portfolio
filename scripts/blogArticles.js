    body:        '<p>One of the biggest sports stories of the year was the announcement of Kobe Bryants retirement. Many regard him as arguably one of the greatest players in NBA history. A 17-time All-Star, 11-time All-NBA selections, five world championships and an MVP award coming his way in the year 2008. The accolades could go on and on but you get the point.</p><p><img src="img/kobe.jpg" class="pull-left" >And now at the end of this NBA season, Kobe Bryant will be gone and the only thing left to remember him by are the memories. It\'s Amazing how long its been yet it seems like it was just yesterday that this skinny kid frim Philadelphia was drafted by the New Orleans Hornets in 1996 before ultimately ending up in Los Angeles. 20 years its been since he stepped on that draft night stage with no clue about the player that he would become. <br><br> Fast forward to present day, the Lakers stink. And to top it all off Kobe is the worst shooter in the entire league by percentage. Some say its due to the amount of years hes played and the wear and tear on his body. Others look to his old age and many believe you could blame his recent play on the amount of injuries he\'s sustained in the past few years. Whatever the case may be the box office attraction that is Kobe Bryant has not diminished, in fact, it has increased. Stadiums around the country are sold out any time the Lakers come to town so that fans could get one last look at The Mamba. Most of his career, Kobe has been hated anywhere besides Los Angeles (naturally). But the hate directed towards this man came out of jealousy, anger, frustration, and most importantly, respect. Fans all over the country despised Kobe when he came to play against their teams because he was just that good. They hoped and hoped that their own star players would someday become good enough to be able to challenge Kobes greatness and beat him. Rarely has that worked, especially in playoff contests. They hated, but respected him because the amount of time and energy he put in to strengthen his game and become the best player he could possibly be is unparalelled. <br><br> Nowadays, Kobe gets more cheers than jeers. Since everyone knows that he is retireing, fans seem to be confused as to what they would like to see most. Their team win, or Kobe go off for 30 or 40 points? On some nights they might see a Kobe show but they would beat the Lakers all at the same time, which would be ideal. But Kobe spent most of the first half of the season shooting bricks. His legs were not under him, and his body was not used to the high level of play that an NBA game requires after missing almost two full seasons. He has started coming into his own with a group of young players around him leading the show. But when Kobe has a chance, he still shows flashes of that same old kobe that everyone has been accustomed to.  </p>'

    body: '<p>Ken Griffey Jr. was baseball royalty all along, the son of a three-time All-Star who played 19 seasons in the majors, the last two alongside him. Junior was the first overall pick in the 1987 draft, made it to the big leagues two years later as a teenager and always seemed destined for greatness.<img src="img/kengriffey.jpg" class="pull-right" >Griffey had the whole package, and it took him only one season to become an All-Star, earning that distinction for the first of 13 times the year after his 1989 debut. He went on to become the sixth-leading home run hitter in history (630) and one of the most complete players of his generation, earning the AL MVP award in 1997 and winning 10 consecutive Gold Gloves as the Seattle Mariners’ center fielder. In a 10-year stretch from 1991-2000, Griffey averaged 40 home runs, 113 RBI and a .976 on-base-plus-slugging percentage, before a series of injuries hampered his play during the second half of his 22-year career, after he joined his hometown Cincinnati Reds in 2000. During his heyday in the mid-to-late ’90s, Griffey, teammate Alex Rodriguez and Barry Bonds were regarded as the premier position players of their era. But while the last two were later directly linked to the use of performance-enhancing drugs, Griffey never aroused skepticism.</p>'  },

    body:        '<p> <img src="img/camruss.jpg" class="pull-left"> Last weekend, the Seattle Seahawks struggle season officially ended at the hands of the Carolina Panthers. The game summed up the entire 2015 season for the Hawks as they struggled early, couldn\'t seem get anything going, and made a late push towards the end of the game only to fall short. The first half was a disaster for the Seahawks and Russell Wilson who threw two interceptions including one to Luke Keuchly who took it back 20 yards for a touchdown. The Panthers were all over the Seahawks both on offense and defense not allowing any type of positive play to occur while having their way on the offensive end. Carolina, led by Cam Newton, jumped out to a 31 to nothing lead in the first half and silenced the doubters who believed the Seahawks had much more experience than the Panthers and were picking Seattle to win this game despite having to play in Carolina. The silence only lasted for a short while. You see these two teams are no stranges to each other. Russell Wilson and Cam Newton had gone head to head four other times before this meeting in years past, with all four victories going to Russell Wilson who seemed to always be able to make one more play than Cam Newton was able to. The two teams had met in the divisional round of last years NFL playoffs which resulted in a 31-17 win for Seattle. So on Sunday, after the first 30 minutes of football had been played and the Panthers were sitting with a comfortable 31 point lead, it finally seemed that Cam Newton and the Panthers had gotten the monkey off their back and were going to beat their rivals, the Seattle Seahawks. Until the second half started of course. The Hawks opened the second half with a touchdown drive that included a loft pass from Russell Wilson to Jermaine Kearse in the corner of the endzone. They followed that up with a 30 yard bomb from Wilson to Tyler Lockette to cut the lead to 31-14. The defense also finally came alive sacking Cam Newton on pivotal plays and getting the ball back into the hands of their offense. Then, in the 4th quarter, Tyler Lockette caught a sideline pass that at first was called incomplete until the replay showed that he did in fact get one foot down and a sliver of his big toe on the other foot to turn it into a 20 yard gain for the Seahawks. This set up a play that maybe only Russell Wilson could make in the NFL. After the snap, he backed up surveying the the field only to see multiple Panthers defenders coming for him. As he attempted to twist and turn trying to get away, he was able to find one blue jersey in the back of the endzone and threw a bullet to none other than Jermaine Kearse again over the outstretched hand of one of the best corners in the game Josh Norman. After a Hauschka field goal on the ensuing drive, the score was cut to 31-24 and the season rested on one onside kick. Everyone had deja vu of last year against the Packers which many regard as one of the best NFC Championship games of all time. But it was not to be this year as Thomas Davis did a masterful job at recovering the football despite being leveled by Deshawn Shead. And just like that, the Panthers put the Seahawks out of their misery. The struggle season came to an end which felt like the Seahawks were hanging by a thread the entire time despite being back to back NFC champions.  <img src="" class="pull-right"></p>'
